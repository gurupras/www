== Introduction

[.lead]
ASST0 introduces you to the source code and tools that you will be using
throughout the rest of the `ops-class.org` assignments.

It is unlikely that you have used OS/161 before, but some of the
other tools may be familiar to you:

* http://os161.eecs.harvard.edu[*OS/161*]: OS/161 includes both
. the sources of the the operating system you will be designing,
implementing, running and debugging, and
. a toolchain for cross compiling and running your kernel, including a
machine simulator called `sys161` footnote:[Also known as System/161].
* https://git-scm.com/[*Git*]: a distributed source control tools that
tracks your changes to OS/161 and enables effective collaboration.
* https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/[*GDB*]: the GNU debugger which allows you
to control and inspect your running system.
  
=== Objectives

After completing ASST0 you should:

. Have set up your OS/161 development environment.
. Understand the source code structure of OS/161.
. Be comfortable navigating the OS/161 sources to determine where and how
things are done.
. Have been introduced to Git and GDB.
. Be able to, modify, build and run your first OS/161 kernel.

=== A Note on Cut-and-Paste

Another assignment objective is to get you up to speed working efficiently in
a Linux development environment using standard command-line development
tools. Earlier versions of this assignment had come to contain a lot of
cut-and-paste snippets that students could run from the command line. While
students found this helpful, we have decided to remove many of these
instructions and provide direction in English text instead. This is for the
simple reason that too many students were simply skimming the assignment text
while cutting and pasting the relevant sections into their terminal.

Unlike many of the things you will find online ASST0 is _not a tutorial._ You
will go slower, but you will learn a lot more from figuring out how to:
"Run the first OS/161 thread test and then shut down your kernel" than how
to:
[source,bash]
----
trinity@zion:~$ sys161 kernel "tt1;q"
----

Following these kinds of written instructions will also better prepare you to
interact with other OS/161 hackers in person and in the online forum.

=== A Note on Learning Git

Another objective of this course is to help you learn to use common
development tools, particularly Git. However, like most programming tools the
best way to get started with and continue to learn Git is through the
extensive online documentation and multiple good online tutorials
(https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/[1],
https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1[2],
https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&q=git%20tutorial[etc.]).

As a result, we have removed Git guides from the `ops-class.org`
documentation. Not only is any documentation we could provide much less
likely to be complete and up-to-date, but this will provide you with good
practice in online learning. Feel free to ask your course staff or other
students for help, either in person or using the online forum. Chances are
many of them use Git or something similar on a daily basis. When you become a
professional hacker, you will too.

Like anything else, learning Git takes practice and patience. But here's one
simple tip: *read the output and error messages generated by Git commands.*
Git produces remarkably useful output, particularly when an error occurs or
when it hasn't accomplished what you asked. Frequently the output tells you
_exactly_ what to do to address whatever issue you are facing, down to the
commands that you should type.

=== Collaboration Guidelines

ASST0 focuses on getting your environment set up and asking you to begin
familiarizing yourself with the OS/161 source you will be modifying. There is
a small amount of coding involved, but not too much. While the assignment is
ungraded, here are the guidelines for how to work together and work with your
partner (if you have one):

TIP: Working side-by-side with your partner on ASST0 is *strongly
encouraged*.
  
TIP: Helping other students set up their `ops-class.org` environment is
encouraged.
    
TIP: Helping each other with Git is encouraged.
    
TIP: Discussing the code reading questions and browsing the source code with
other students is encouraged.
    
WARNING: Dividing the code reading questions and development tasks between
partners is discouraged.
  
CAUTION: Copying any answers from anyone who is not your partner or anywhere
else and submitting them as your own is cheating.
  
CAUTION: You may not refer to or incorporate any external sources without
explicit permission footnote:[Which you are extremely unlikely to get.].

[.lead]
Developing for OS/161 requires a specialized set of tools, including the
`sys161` simulator along with a GCC cross-compiler allowing you to create
MIPS r3000 binaries that `sys161` can execute.

We support three options allowing you to access the OS/161 toolchain. You
can:

. install the toolchain natively on your own Ubuntu machine,
. run a Ubuntu virtual machine that has the toolchain installed as a guest on
a Windows or Mac host,
. or use a toolchain that has been pre-installed on a shared machine accessible
via SSH.

Each option is described in more detail below. However, #1 requires access to
a computer running Ubuntu Linux, which you may or may not have. If you run
Mac or Windows, #2 or #3 are your best options. And if your course staff has
set up a shared machine for you, #3 is a very straightforward choice. That
said, there are other tradeoffs to each choice, so we suggest that you read
through your options carefully before making a decision.

=== Ubuntu Host

If you have a computer running Ubuntu Linux, we have packaged the OS/161
toolchain for the last two Ubuntu [.spelling_exception]#LTS# releases (12.04
Precise and 14.04 Trusty) in a
https://launchpad.net/~geoffrey-challen/+archive/ubuntu/os161-toolchain/[Launchpad
PPA]. Installation is simple:

[source,bash]
----
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:geoffrey-challen/os161-toolchain
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install os161-toolchain
----

If you'd like to use a different version of Ubuntu you'll need to modify the
APT configuration generated above to use whichever LTS version most
immediately precedes yours.
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/CommandLine[This help page]
should get you started.

If you don't have a computer running Linux, and you have a spare computer
around, you may want to give http://www.ubuntu.com[Ubuntu] a try. Maintaining
your own Linux machine is a great way to learn more about system
administration and, to some degree, about operating systems as well.

=== Ubuntu Guest Using Vagrant

If you'd prefer to develop on your own machine but don't run Ubuntu Linux, we
have a Vagrant configuration allowing you to easily fire up a
https://launchpad.net/~geoffrey-challen/+archive/ubuntu/os161-toolchain/[VirtualBox]
guest virtual machine on your Windows or Mac host footnote:[We'll talk a lot
more about virtualization in class, but here's one example of how useful it
can be.].

The first step is to install https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant], which
happily comes with installers for most common operating systems. Next you need
to https://github.com/ops-class/vagrant[get our `Vagrantfile` ]which describes
how to provision and configure your virtual machine. You'll need
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[Git installed]
to complete this next step.  Pick or create an empty directory to use for your
OS/161 sources. Then clone our Vagrant repository into that directory.

Once that's done, you should be able to run `vagrant up` from the directory
containing our `Vagrantfile`. Note that `vagrant up` will take a few minutes
to complete the first time, and you need to be online so that Vagrant can
download various external resources:

[source,bash]
----
vagrant up # This may take a few minutes
----

Assuming `vagrant up` completes successfully, you should be able to log in to
your running virtual machine and run the OS/161 tools:

[source,bash]
----
$ vagrant ssh
trinity@zion:~$ sys161
sys161: System/161 release 2.0.6, compiled Dec 23 2015 21:58:13
sys161: Usage: sys161 [sys161 options] kernel [kernel args...]
...
----

By default our configuration shares the `src` subdirectory of the directory
where you installed our `Vagrantfile` with the virtual machine, meaning that
you can edit your OS/161 source code either inside or outside of the virtual
machine. Given that by default our VM does not have a GUI, if you prefer a
graphical source code editor you may want to edit your code using tools
installed on the host. However, you need to be logged in to your VM to
compile and run your OS/161 kernel.

If you are having trouble, make sure that all Vagrant commands (`vagrant up`,
`vagrant ssh`, etc.) are run from the same directory as the `Vagrantfile` you
created previously. That's just how Vagrant works.

==== Notes for Windows users

The README on our https://github.com/ops-class/vagrant[OS/161 Vagrant
repository GitHub repository] describes some potential pitfalls for Windows
users with the Vagrant installation and initial VM creation. However, another
problem is known to exist where Windows hosts will not allow the guest to
create symbolic links in shared folders. Because OS/161 generates symbolic
links during `bmake depend` step, this problem will cause that step to fail.

There are several workarounds. The first is to make sure that you run all of
your `vagrant` commands as a Windows administrator, which will provide the
guest with the required permissions to create symbolic links. Note that this
includes both `vagrant up` and `vagrant ssh`. The second workaround is to not
share your OS/161 source folder with the host, but of course this will
prevent you from directly editing your sources from the host.

=== Preexisting External Installation

You may have access to a shared machine with the OS/161 toolchain installed,
allowing you to work remotely over SSH. While this is by far the easiest
option, it does limit your ability to work offline and may affect your choice
of source code editor.
 
=== Do-It-Yourself Installation on Other Flavors of UNIX

We don't support this option, but if you'd like to try instructions are
available at the http://os161.eecs.harvard.edu[OS/161 website]. You will need
to download, configure, compile and install from the OS/161 toolchain
sources. Linux and other UNIX variants are likely to work. Superheroes have
gotten things to work on OSX. Please use the most recent version of the
cross-compilation toolchain and System/161.

=== Other Virtualization Options

Virtualization is hot these days and so you have a lot of options, including
the https://aws.amazon.com/[Amazon EC2] https://aws.amazon.com/free/[free
tier] to create an Ubuntu VM in the cloud and
https://www.virtualbox.org/[VirtualBox] or http://www.vmware.com/[VMware] to
create an Ubuntu VM locally, preferably one of the LTS versions (12.04,
14.04) supported by our PPA. Once you've done that you can use the
instructions above for installing the software on native Ubuntu.

</div>
++++

[.lead]
Now that you have your development environment ready, on to the fun stuff:
building and booting your first OS/161 kernel.

=== Download the OS/161 Source Code

We distribute the OS/161 source code using Git. Starting with a clone of our
repository makes it easy for us to distribute updates, bug fixes, and new
OS/161 releases, which can be merged easily into your development repository.

First, choose a directory to work in:

* If you are using our Vagrant virtual machine,
you can run Git either inside or outside of your virtual machine, assuming
your host machine has Git installed. For simplicity, we suggest cloning the
sources inside your virtual machine in `/home/trinity/src`, which should be
an empty directory.
* If you have the toolchain installed natively you can create your source
directory wherever you want.

Let's say you've chosen a directory called `src`, which should either not
exist or (in the case of the Vagrant VM) be empty. Clone
https://gitlab.ops-class.org/staff/os161[our `ops-class.org` Git repository]
into that directory. *Note that a simple `git clone` will not do the right
thing.* Take a look at the man page for `git clone` or peruse the help output
to make sure you get it right.

Note that we refer to this directory as your _source directory_. In contrast,
your _root directory_ is where your built kernel and other binaries are
installed and where you run `sys161`. That's an important piece of
terminology to get right.

=== Configure Your OS/161 Source Tree

The next step is to configure the OS/161 sources by running the `configure`
command located at the base of your source tree. You need to do this (very
short) step only when you completely remove your source tree for some reason.
The only configuration step is to set up where various binaries--including
system executable and your kernel--will be created when you run `make` in
later steps. Run `configure --help` to find out more including available
command line options.

Note that by default OS/161 installs things to the root directory
`$HOME/os161/root`, which is a fine plan to put things if you are working on
a shared machine. For our dedicated VM we use `$HOME/root` to shorten the
directory paths a bit, but this requires that you use the `--ostree` argument
to `configure`. If you forget this argument either now or when you need to
rerun `configure` later, you will install things into `$HOME/os161/root`.
*This has caused confusion for some students previously, so please be
careful.*

=== Configure Your OS/161 Kernel

The kernel sources for OS/161 are in the `kern` subdirectory, which has its
own configuration script. Change into `kern/conf` and look around. You should
notice a configuration script, a base configuration file (`conf.kern`), and
four configurations that include `conf.kern`.

You should take a look at `kern.conf` and one of the configurations to get a
sense of the format. But for now, the only thing we're concerned about is
ensuring that we enable `dumbvm` for `ASST0`. You're going to write a
full-fledged virtual memory (VM) system in `ASST3`, but for the first few
assignments `dumbvm` provides enough of a "dumb" VM to allow you to proceed.
Configure a kernel now with `dumbvm` enabled.

The OS/161 kernel configuration process sets various options that control how
your kernel gets built, so unlike the configuration step above you will
probably need to modify these files at some point during later assignments.
In particular, `conf.kern` determines what source files get included in your
kernel build, so if you add sources to the kernel you'll need to add them to
`conf.kern` as well.

=== Build Your OS/161 Kernel

Once you're successfully configured your OS/161 kernel you should have a
directory to compile in, as well as a reminder about a build step that you
might forget. Once you change into that directory you are ready to build a
kernel!

One important note before you start. You are probably used to using
https://www.gnu.org/software/make/[GNU `make`] to build software on UNIX-like
systems. However, the OS/161 sources use
http://www.crufty.net/help/sjg/bmake.htm[BSD `make`], which has a different
`Makefile` syntax footnote:[Why? Because
http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~dholland/[David Holland] is a big
http://www.netbsd.org/[NetBSD] hacker.]. To avoid confusion, BSD `make` has
been installed on your system as `bmake`. So while you might normally run
`make clean` to reset your build and remove all of the build targets, when
working with OS/161 you would run `bmake clean`.

There are three steps:

. *Building the dependencies (`bmake depend`)*. This scans all of the source
files that you have configured to be part of your kernel and ensures that all
their header files are also included.
. *Building the kernel (`bmake`)*. This generates your kernel binary.
. *Installing the kernel (`bmake install`)*. This installs your kernel into
the root directory that you configured above.

Run these three commands now and check that they complete successfully. Then
change into your root directory and look around. You should see a fresh
kernel. If you don't, review the steps above until your kernel builds
successfully.

=== Configuring `sys161`
 
Now that you have a kernel, the next step is to run it. But how? Given that
your kernel doesn't yet have any useful features, it would be impossible to
use it to run an actual computer, or even in a fully-featured virtual machine
like VirtualBox.

Instead, OS/161 kernels are built to be run by a special-purpose system
simulator called `sys161`, or System/161. Compared to other virtual machines
or full-system simulators, `sys161` is much simpler and faster but retains
enough realism to enable kernel development using OS/161. degree of realism.
Apart from floating point support and certain issues relating to RAM cache
management, it provides an accurate emulation of a MIPS processor
footnote:[If you'd like to know more about System/161 and OS/161,
http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~syrah/papers/sigcse-02/sigcse-02.pdf[this paper]
provides an excellent overview.].

Unlike OS/161, we _do not_ expect you to modify `sys161`. However, you do
need to _configure_ the simulated machine that `sys161` provides by choosing
the number of simulated CPU cores, the amount of simulated memory, and the
number of simulated disk drives. link:/files/sys161.conf[Here is a
`sys161.conf` file] that you can
use to get started. But you should read and understand the structure of this
configuration file so that you can modify it as needed in later assignments.

=== Running Your First Kernel

Now that you have a kernel and a `sys161` configuration file you should be
ready to go. Fire up your kernel and see what happens. Poke around a bit at
the menu. Run a test or two. And then shut down.

What just happened? You ran one computer program (`sys161`) that loaded your
kernel (from the `kernel`) file. Your kernel is itself a program expressed as
a series of MIPS r3000 instructions, which were interpreted by `sys161` and
simulated as if they had executed on real hardware. Of course, this includes
the ability read from and write to a console device, allowing you to interact
with your running kernel.

Examine the output produced by your kernel as it boots and shuts down. You
should be able to answer the following questions:

* Which version of System/161 and OS/161 are you using?
* Where was OS/161 developed and copyrighted?
* How much memory and how many CPU cores was System/161 configured to use?
* What configuration was used by your running kernel?
* How many times has your kernel been compiled?

Before going on try the following exercises:

* Boot your OS/161 kernel with 8 cores.
* Try booting with 256K of memory. What happens?
* Configure System/161 to use a fixed value to initialize its random number
generator. (This can be helpful when debugging non-deterministic kernel
behavior.)

=== Kernel Development Workflow

As you saw above, building an OS/161 kernel from scratch involves five steps:

. Configuring the entire OS/161 source tree by running `configure` in the
root of the source directory
. Configuring the kernel by running `config` in the `kern/conf` subdirectory
. Building the dependencies by running `bmake depend` in the compilation
subdirectory
. Building the kernel by running `bmake`
. Installing the kernel by running `bmake install`

The first step only needs to be done when you download a new OS/161 source
tree. The second step only needs to be done when you start a new assignment
or add files to your kernel build by editing `kern/conf/conf.kern`.
Rebuilding the dependencies in step three is also not usually necessary
unless you have reconfigured your kernel.

So that leaves the last two (`bmake ; bmake install`) as your normal kernel
development workflow. Note that `bmake` is usually smart enough to detect
what you changed and not recompile things unnecessarily, but if you think
that it hasn't accomplished that correctly you can always run a `bmake clean`
to force it to start over.

However, if things aren't building properly you may want to rerun the kernel
configuration and dependencies steps just to be sure. Step 1 is almost never
necessary to repeat unless you've completely started over and removed your
entire previous OS/161 source tree.

=== Building the User Space Tools

If you change into your root directory you should see only a few files,
including your compiled kernel, a symbolic link pointing to that kernel, and
the `sys161.conf` file that configures `sys161`. That's fine for now, and all
your need until ASST2.

But your OS/161 kernel would not be very interesting or useful if it couldn't
run user programs. So let's build those now. Head over to the base of your
source directory and run `bmake` followed by `bmake install`. This generates
a lot of output, but when it's done return to your root directory. You should
see a directory structure including `bin` and `testbin` directories
containing cross-compiled user binaries that your OS/161 kernel will
eventually be able to run.

Note that building the user space tools is _not_ part of the kernel
development cycle. Unless you modify or add tests in the `userland`
subdirectory of your source directory--which you are encouraged to do--you
should not need to rebuild or reinstall these binaries. And until you begin
ASST2 your kernel can't run user binaries anyway, so this part of the build
process is completely useless. We only point this out because compiling and
installing the user space tools takes enough time to be annoying, so don't
let it slow you down unnecessarily. Focus your development loop on your
kernel.

== Exploring OS/161

[.lead]
One of the core challenges of the `ops-class.org` assignments is working with
OS/161, a large, complicated, and unfamiliar code base.

OS/161 contains roughly 40K non-commenting lines of code and 25K comments
spread across 570 C, header, and assembly files. Reading and understanding
all of that code would take much more time than you want to spend. And of
course you are going to make things worse, since your solutions will add
considerably to what is already there footnote:[The ASS3 solution set adds 4K
LoC.].

Luckily, OS/161 contains a large amount of code that you never need to
understand or change, some amount of code that you need to be familiar but
not intimate with, and a small amount that you must understand in detail.
Distinguishing between these categories is critical to your success. For
example, the `LAMEbus`, `semaphore`, and `loadelf` source code each fall into
one of these three categories. See if you can decide which is which, or
return to this question after you work on some of the questions below.

To become familiar with a code base, there is no substitute for actually
poking around. Browse through the tree a bit to get a sense of how things are
structured. Glance through some source code for files that look interesting.
OS/161 is also very well commented, as befits a pedagogical code base.

Most of the OS/161 sources are C source (`.c`) and header (`.h`) files. Your
kernel does also contain a bit of assembly code (`.S`) files. You will not
need to understand or modify the assembly code, but it does contain some
fairly interesting pieces of code executed during boot and during context
switches. So you may want to take a look at it at some point. The assembly
code is also _extremely_ well commented footnote:[Thanks David!].

You should use the code reading questions below to guide an initial
exploration of the OS/161 sources. While the questions won't require you look
at every line of code or even every file, we _strongly recommend_ that you at
least glance at all the kernel sources in the `kern` subdirectory.

Some parts of the code may seem confusing since we have not discussed how any
OS/161 subsystems work. However, it is still useful to review the code now
and get a high-level idea of what is happening in each subsystem. If you do
not understand the low-level details now, that is fine.

=== The Top of the Source Directory

Your OS/161 source directory contains the following files:

* `CHANGES`: describes the evolution of OS/161 and changes in previous
versions.
* `configure`: the top-level configuration script that you ran previously.
* `Makefile`: the top-level `Makefile` used to build the user space binaries.

The source directory contains the following subdirectories:

* `common/`: code used both by the kernel and user programs, mostly standard C library functions.
* `design/`: contains design documents describing several OS/161 components.
* `kern/`: the kernel source code, and the subdirectory where you will spend
most of your time.
* `man/`: the OS/161 man pages appear here.  The man pages 
document (or specify) every program, every function in the C library, and
every system call. You will use the system call man pages for reference in
the course of ASST2. The man pages are HTML and can be read with any browser.
* `mk/`: fragments of `Makefiles` used to build the system.
* `userland/`: user space libraries and program code.

If you have previously configured and built in this directory there are also
some additional files and directories that have been created, such as
`defs.mk` and `build/`.

=== User Land

In the `userland/` source subdirectory, you will find:

* `bin/`: all the utilities that are typically found in
`/bin/`&mdash;`cat`, `cp`, `ls`, etc. Programs in `/bin/` are considered
fundamental utilities that the system needs to run.
* `include/`: these are the include files that you would typically find 
in `/usr/include` (in our case, a subset of them).  These are user include
files, not kernel include files.
* `lib/`: library code lives here.  We have only two libraries: 
`libc`, the C standard library, and `hostcompat`, which is for recompiling
OS/161 programs for the host UNIX system.  There is also a `crt0` directory,
which contains the startup code for user programs.
* `sbin/`: this is the source code for the utilities typically found in 
`/sbin` on a typical UNIX installation. In our case, there are some utilities
that let you halt the machine, power it off, and reboot it, among other things.
* `testbin/`: these are pieces of test code that we will use to
test and grade your assignments.

You don't need to understand the files in `userland/bin/`, `userland/sbin/`,
and `userland/testbin/` now, but you certainly will later on. Eventually, you
will want to modify these or write your own utilities and these are good
models. Similarly, you need not read and understand everything in
`userland/lib` and `userland/include` but you should know enough about what's
there to be able to get around the source tree easily.  The rest of our code
walk-through is going to focus on `kern/`.

=== Kernel Sources

Now let's navigate to the `kern/` source subdirectory. Once again, there is a
`Makefile`.  This `Makefile` installs header files but does not build
anything. In addition, we have more subdirectories for each component of the
kernel as well as some utility directories and configuration files.

==== `kern/arch`

This is where architecture-specific code goes. By architecture-specific, we
mean the code that differs depending on the hardware platform on which you're
running. There are two directories here: `mips` which contains code specific
to the MIPS processor and `sys161` which contains code specific to the
System/161 simulator.

* `kern/arch/mips/conf/conf.arch`: this file tells the kernel
configuration script where to find the machine-specific, low-level functions it
needs (throughout `kern/arch/mips/`).
* `kern/arch/mips/include/`: this folder and its subdirectories
include files for the machine-specific constants and functions.
* `kern/arch/mips/`: The other directories contain source files for 
the machine-dependent code that the kernel needs to run.  Most of this code
is quite low-level.
* `kern/arch/sys161/conf/conf.arch`: Similar to `mips/conf/conf.arch`.
* `kern/arch/sys161/include:` These files are include files for the 
System/161-specific hardware, constants, and functions.

==== `kern/compile/`

This is where you build kernels. In the compile directory, you will find one
subdirectory for each kernel configuration target you have used you want to
build. For example, if you configure your kernel with the `DUMBVM`
configuration to turn on `dumbvm`, a `DUMBVM` subdirectory will be created in
`kern/compile` where you can compile your `dumbvm` kernel. This directory and
build organization is typical of UNIX installations and is not universal
across all operating systems.

* `kern/conf/config`: is the script that takes a configuration file, 
like `GENERIC`, and creates the corresponding build directory.

==== `kern/test/`

This directory contains kernel tests that evaluate multiple parts of your
system. Some of these will work right away (`km1`, `km2`, `sy1`), others will
not (`sy2`, `sy3`), and others you will have to write (`sy5`). You are more
than welcome--encouraged even--to add your own kernel tests. However, please
note that during automated tests we will replace the contents of this
directory to ensure that your kernel runs the right tests.

==== `kern/dev/`

This is where all the low level device management code is stored. Unless you
are really interested, you can safely ignore most of this directory.

==== `kern/include/`

These are the include files that the kernel needs. The `kern` subdirectory
contains include files that are visible not only to the operating system
itself, but also to user programs. Consider why it's named
[.spelling_exception]#"kern"# and where the files end up when installed.

==== `kern/lib/`

These contain library code used throughout the kernel: arrays, kernel
`printf`, etc.

==== `kern/main/`

This is where the kernel is initialized and where the kernel main function
and menu are implemented.

==== `kern/thread/`

This directory contains the code implementing the thread abstraction and
synchronization primitives.

==== `kern/synchprobs/`

This is the directory that contains the starter code that you will need to
complete ASST1.

==== `kern/syscall/`

This is where you will add code to create and manage user level processes. As
it stands now, OS/161 runs only kernel threads--there is no support for user
level code. (Try running the shell from the OS/161 menu and see what
happens.) In ASST2, you'll implement this support.

==== `kern/vm/`

This directory is also fairly vacant. In ASST3, you'll implement virtual
memory and most of your code will go in here.

==== `kern/vfs/`

The file system implementation has two directories which we'll present in
turn. `kern/vfs` is the file system _independent_ layer&mdash;`vfs` stands
for virtual file system. It establishes a framework into which you can add
new file systems easily. You will want to go look at `vfs.h` and `vnode.h`
before looking at this directory.

==== `kern/fs/`

This is where the actual file system implementations go. The subdirectory
`sfs` contains the implementation of the simple file system.

=== Source Exploration Exercises

Use your new-found knowledge of the OS/161 source code to answer the
questions that follow. You may also find standard UNIX utilities like `find`
and `grep` useful when searching through your OS/161 source code.

. What function initializes the kernel during boot, and what subsystems are
currently initialized?
. What VM system does your kernel use by default? What is wrong with it?
. OS/161 ships with two working synchronization primitives. What are they?
. How do you create a thread in OS/161? Give some examples of code that
currently creates multiple threads.
. OS/161 has a system for printing debugging messages to the console. How
does it work? How could it be useful?
. What do `copyin` and `copyout` do? Why is special about these functions
compared to other approaches to copying memory in C, like `memmove`?
. What is a zombie thread?
. What is the difference between a thread sleeping and a thread yielding?
. Explain the difference between machine dependent and machine independent
code. Where would you put both in the OS/161 source tree?
. What functions are used to enable and restore interrupts? Would this be
sufficient to ensure mutual exclusion on an OS/161 kernel?

== Your OS/161 Toolchain

[.lead]
Successfully developing an OS/161 kernel requires more than just building and
running a kernel. You also need to edit source code, share code with others,
and debug and test your kernel.

To complete ASST0, we'll provide an overview and some exercises using the
rest of the OS/161 toolchain: in particular,  Git and GDB. But let's start
with discussing how to edit OS/161 source code.

=== Editing OS/161

While we don't specifically support any particular editing or code browsing
software, we suggest that you use an editor that is designed for working with
source code. Command line tools like `vim` work well and, when combined with
`ctags` and `tmux`, produce a very powerful command-line development
environment. Graphical editors like Eclipse or Visual Studio are also fine
but more of a hassle to set up. Decide what works best for you.

When you read and begin to modify source code, you will also want to absorb
it's stylistic conventions. Like any other hacker, David Holland has his
preferences about indentation, line width, function signatures, where to put
braces, and tabs versus spaces. Adopting these will make it much easier to
work on OS/161 and ensure that your changes fit in. This is also a critical
skill to learn as you begin to contribute to other shared code bases. At
minimum, you and your partner should agree on style so that you don't drive
each other crazy or spend hours reformatting each others' code.

As described previously, we are not going to go into the use of Git in
detail. *But we will point out that using Git is not optional for completing
the `ops-class.org` assignments.* We distribute our base sources using Git
and will use Git to push updates to you. Our testing tool, `test161`, submits
assignments for testing using Git.

One additional requirement is that you have a _private_ Git repository so
that you do not inadvertently share your solutions with others. The `test161`
submission system will refuse to grade your assignments if it detects that
your Git repository is public. Getting your hands on a private Git repository
is not hard. If you are a student,
https://www.github.com[GitHub] will allow you to set
up a limited number of private repositories for instructional use.
https://www.gitlab.com[`GitLab.com`] provides private Git repositories for
free, as do other sites such as
[.spelling_exception]#https://www.bitbucket.org[BitBucket]#. And your course
staff may also set up private Git repositories for you to use.

If you are completing the `ops-class.org` assignments alone, you may wonder
whether you need Git. The short answer is *yes*. Every programmer, including
you, should get in the habit of setting up version control every time you
start a project. It's the first thing that you should do. Always. Every time.
No exceptions. Why? There are a lot of reasons.

==== Git exercises

If you are just getting started with Git, here are some exercises specific to
OS/161 that you may want to try:

* Modify your kernel so that it prints out your email address at the right
spot during boot. Use Git to show what files have changed. Commit your
changes, and confirm that your work tree is now clean. Use Git to show the
history of your repository, and to generate a line-by-line breakdown of who
is responsible for each of the current lines in the file that prints the
menu.
* Modify your kernel so that it prints a bad word during boot. Use Git to
show what files have changed. Decide that this is bad idea and use Git to
back out your change.
* Modify your kernel so that it builds but does not boot. (Try adding a null
pointer exception somewhere during the boot sequence or in the menu.) Check
in your changes and build a kernel. Run your kernel and realize your mistake.
Use Git to revert your previous commit containing the mistake. Confirm that
your kernel now builds and boots properly.
* Repeat the previous exercise but make your changes in a new branch. When
you realize your mistake, return to your master branch and show that you can
still build and boot. At that point abandon and delete the new branch you
created.
* Set up a private remote repository so that you and your partner can share
changes. Configure your repository so that it pushes and pulls your master
branch to your new repository by default. Pick a file to edit jointly,
something long enough so that you both can add changes. Add a comment to the
top of the file. Have your partner add a comment to the bottom of the file.
Use Git to merge your changes through the remote repository.
* Pick another file to edit jointly, but this time create a conflict by both
adding different comments to the same line of the file. Using Git, confirm
that the edits create a merge conflict. Use Git to handle the conflict and
complete the merge. Try doing this twice and see if you can force each
partner to handle the merge conflict.

=== Debugging Using GDB

GDB--or the GNU debugger--is another extremely well-documented tool which we
will let you learn on your own. Unlike Git, GDB is not required to complete
the `ops-class.org` assignments. But that's like saying that shoes aren't
required to climb Mt. Everest. You can make it without GDB, through good old
`printf` debugging and pure deductive reasoning. But it will be very, very
painful. You will be much happier if you learn to use GDB.

The only complication to using GDB to debug your OS/161 kernel is that the
machine simulator `sys161` gets in the way. As a result, the way that you
hook up the debugger to your running kernel is a bit different than you might
be used to if you have used GDB previously. For example, if you try this in
your root directory:
[source,bash]
----
os161-gdb sys161 kernel
----
you will end up debugging `sys161`, not your kernel, which is not what you
want. And if you run
[source,bash]
----
os161-gdb kernel
----
nothing will happen at all because you haven't started the `sys161` simulator
required to run your kernel.

Instead, you need to start the simulator and the debugger separately.
However, it is critical that they run in the same directory. A terminal
multiplexer like `tmux` comes in handy here. Here's what to do:

. In one terminal, change to your root directory and start your kernel. There
is a special option to `sys161` that will cause it to wait for a connection
from the debugger before booting. Use that to make sure that you can
establish the connection before boot.
. In a second terminal, change to your root directory and start the debugger
by running `os161-gdb kernel`.

Unfortunately, you are not quite done. You may have noticed that the kernel
is still waiting for a debugger connection. To establish that connection,
type the following at the GDB prompt:
[source,bash]
----
target remote unix:.sockets/gdb
----

At this point GDB should confirm that it is connected to the `sys161`
simulator and you can proceed. Note that the kernel is stopped at this point
as if you have set up a breakpoint, so you need to instruct it to continue.

Happily, new versions of `sys161` will wait explicitly at shutdown for a
debugger connection if something goes wrong. Try booting your kernel and
running the `panic` command to observe this behavior. This gives you a chance
to connect a debugger and poke around in cases where your kernel panics and
you weren't expecting it. *That said, we suggest that you always run your
kernel with the debugger attached from boot.*

If you get tired of typing these commands, there are ways to set up a GDB
alias for the `target` command and have it be run when GDB starts. For the
even more adventurous, you can set up a `tmux` script that will automatically
create two windows, boot your kernel in one and start the debugger in the
other. Programming FTW!

Finally, note that because GDB is debugging your kernel through the `sys161`
system simulator, not all GDB features are supported. Watchpoints, for
example, are known not to work. In addition, when stepping through code you
should keep in mind that your kernel is multithreaded and that other threads
may have run in-between each step.

==== GDB exercises

If you are just getting started with GDB, here are some exercises specific to
OS/161 that you may want to try:

* Set a breakpoint on the `panic` function. Initiate a panic from the kernel
menu and confirm that GDB hits the break point. Inspect the call stack and
step up and down a few times before allowing the kernel to continue and
`sys161` to exit.
* Create a panic by modifying your OS/161 source code. Use GDB to find the
source of the panic. If you are working with a partner, have your partner
hide a panic in the source code and use GDB to find it. Then hide one for
them.
* Step through kernel boot, stepping in to and over a few of the boot helper
functions that initialize various subsystems.
* Put a breakpoint on the kernel exception handler and step through it when
it fires. Use it to determine what generates exceptions when your kernel is
sitting idly at the menu.
