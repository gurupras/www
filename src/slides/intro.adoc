I took the red pill

[.nooutline]
== Why I'm Here

[.slider]
* I took CS161 @ Harvard--now also known as CSE 421/521 at the
University at Buffalo--from Margo Seltzer in 2001
* At that point I was a physics major, but I wouldn't be for long..
* ...because I discovered that I loved building computer systems and teaching
people about them. 
* I would up in graduate school (where I TA'd this course many times).
* And graduate school landed me right back here to begin the cycle again.

== Introducing the 2015 Course Staff

We probably have the *best* course staff ever this year: a mixture of new
TAs, veteran volunteers, and a large group of "ninjas"&mdash;students returning
from last year to help out.

.Official Teaching Assistants
[.slider]
. *Jerry Ajay*
. *Ali Ben Ali*
. *Xu Zhen*

[.slide]
--
Ali and Jerry will teach recitations, and all three TAs will mark all graded
work.
--

<<<

.Unofficial Teaching Assistants
[.slider]
. *Yihong Chen*
. *Scott Haseley*
. *Carl Nuessle*
. *Guru Prasad*
. *Jinghao Shi*

[.slide]
--
These https://blue.cse.buffalo.edu[blue] group graduate students will help
with office hours and work on tool development. All are former 421/521
students!
--

<<<

.Ninjas:
[.slider]
. *Dan Conway*
. *Gela Malek Pour*
. *Isaac Reath*
. *Benjamin Rueda*
. *Mark Simpson*
. *Yousuf Zubairi*

[.slide]
--
Our ninjas are all (excellent) returning 2015 undergraduates. You'll see them
in office hours and they are also helping develop course infrastructure.
--

== Operating Systems Briefly Defined

.Operating System:
[.slider]
. A *computer program* that
. *multiplexes hardware resources* and
. *implements useful abstractions*.

[.slide]
--
The OS is just another computer program! [.slide]#(If a large,
complex, mature and mission critical one.)#
--

[.slide]
--
*Multiplexing* allows multiple people or programs to use the same set of
hardware resources--processors, memory, disks, network connection--safely and
efficiently.
--

[.slide]
--
*Abstractions*--processes, threads, address spaces, files, and
sockets--simplify the usage of hardware resources by organizing information
or implementing new capabilities.
--

== Motivating This Class

[.slider]
* How many of you have participated in OS development?
* How many of you regularly program in languages that use operating system
abstractions directly?
* So why study operating systems? Why is this class even offered? *Why is it
required?*

[.meme-top]
Remind me

[.meme-bottom]
What's this for again?

== Why Study Operating Systems?

[.slider]
* *Reality*: this is how computers really work, and as a computer scientist or
engineer you should know how computers really work.
* *Ubiquity*: operating systems are everywhere and you are likely to eventually
encounter them or their limitations.
* *Beauty*: operating systems are examples of mature solutions to difficult
design and engineering problems. Studying them will improve your ability to
design and implement abstractions.

== Why Program Operating Systems?

[.slider]
* *Design*: programming operating systems stresses the importance of careful
design and specification before coding begins. You will learn the value of
design, probably the hard way.
* *Difficulty*: operating systems are large existing code bases where new
solutions have stringest performance requirements. Programming operating
systems will make you a better programmer and improve all of your subsequent
work.
* *Debugging*: debugging operating systems is challenging due to their multi-
threaded nature and the lack of typical debugging support provided to
applications. Again, debugging operating systems will sharpen your debugging
skills.

== Course Structure

[.slider]
* Conceptual learning...
[.slider]
** Lectures
** Recitations
** Exams
* ...by doing (programming).

== Learning Objectives: Conceptual

.When you finish CSE 421/521 you will:
[.slider]
. understand the abstractions supported by modern operating systems
. be able to describe how operating systems policies and mechanisms safely
and efficiently multiplex hardware resources
. be able to analyze historical, current, and emerging operating system
designs and features

[.slide]
--
The main way we will know that you are learning is by your participation in
class and recitations.
--
[.slide]
--
You will be tested for mastery on exams.
--

== Conceptual Progression

[.small.slider]
* Introduction to operating system abstractions and structure.
* Abstracting and multiplexing:
[.slider]
** the CPU--interrupts, context, threads, processes, processor scheduling,
thread synchronization.
** memory--memory layout, address translation, paging and segmentation,
address spaces, translation caching, page fault handling, page eviction,
** swapping.
** storage--spinning disks and Flash, spinning disk scheduling, on-disk
layout, files, buffer cache, crash and recovery.
* Virtualization.
* Networking (time permitting)

== Learning the Concepts

[.slider]
* Attend class.
* Come to class on time:
** Music starts as soon as I can get into the room...
** Lectures will start at 2:05PM sharp and finish by 2:50PM.
* Ask questions during class.
** I'm very flexible about how much we cover this semester.
** I would rather teach less and have everyone understand it.
** Our back-and-forth during class is the one of the few indicators I have of
how much you are absorbing...

== OS/161

* OS/161 is an instructional operating system developed by David Holland at
Harvard University.
* It attempts to strike a balance between Linux and other extremely-mature
systems--too difficult to hack on--and existing instructional operating
systems frameworks--not realistic enough.
* Your OS/161 kernel runs in an emulator, `sys161`, which emulates an MIPS r2000/
r3000 instruction set architecture (ISA).
* Using `sys161` allows us to simplify debugging and hardware support.

== 10,000 Hours

[.slider]
* While many operating systems concepts are elegantly simple, implementing them
is not.
* Therefor, this class is not easy:
** [red]#3.52 (-0.57)# and [red]#4.03 (-0.06)# on "Appropriate Workload"
score in 2013 course evaluations for 421 and 521 respectively (90%+ response rate).
* However, this class is also worthwhile:
** [green]#4.14 (+0.31)# and [green]#4.59 (+0.76)# overall rating (2013).

== Continuous Choose-Your-Own Grade Programming Evaluations

[.slider]
* Almost all assignment grading in CSE421/521 is automated.
* Therefore... you can have your code graded repeatedly whenever you like.
* Therefore... you can stop each assignment whenever you are satisfied with
your grade.
* We are still deciding how to handle the hand-graded parts of the
assignments... stay tuned.

== Continuous Choose-Your-Own Grade Details and Caveats

[.slider]
* Assignments are done in pairs, so find a partner who is interested in
achieving the same grade as you are.
* Note that we do not allow students to work alone except in extremely
unusual
circumstances.
** "I want to work alone" does not represent one of these
situations!
* Assignments are cumulative and we will not distribute solution sets without
a significant penalty.

== Communication

* We will sign you all up for a mass email list.
* We also have a Discourse forum linked off the website which is the best way to
get help quickly.

== Using Email

[.slider]
* If you need to email the course staff (#staff@ops-class.org#), please consider
the following:
[.slider]
** Is this information likely to be available on the website? If yes, go find it!
** Is the answer to this question likely to benefit other students? If yes,
use Discourse.

[.slider]
* Before you email me directly, please also consider the following:
[.slider]
** Is this something that the course staff could answer? If yes, email them.
* Here's the bottom line: the more time we spend answering repetitive email,
the less time we have available to help you with real problems.

== Getting Help: Recitations

* Ali and Jerry will be holding recitations. Unfortunately recitations this
year are for undergraduates only and one is at 8AM.
* Recitations this year will cover a mix of conceptual and assignment-driven
material.
* We will also try to post some screencasts this year!

== Getting Help: Office Hours

[.small]
--
[.slider]
* All TAs and Ninjas will be holding office hours.
** We are hoping to have around 40 hours of office hours scheduled per week,
meaning that you have plenty of opportunities to complete the challenging
CSE 421 assignments.
* Office hours are the best place to get help on the programming assignments.
* CSE 421/521 office hours will be in Davis Hall in locations announced on the
calendar, but probably near Davis 301B or in the Second Floor atrium.
* Just come in and do the assignments during office hours--that way, when you
get stuck, you are in the right place.
--

== Getting Help: Working in Pairs

Partner groups are jointly responsible for joint work.

[.slider]
* If any part is plagiarized, both partners fail.
* If any part is plagiarized, both partners fail.
* If you have concerns about work your partner has submitted, immediately
approach the course staff.
* If you do not we will assume later that your consent was given.
* It is entirely your responsibility to ensure that your team's submission
is fair and reflects your contributions.

[.slide]
--
Pair programming assignments for CSE 421/521 are very clear about what kinds
of collaboration are permitted. We consider violating these expectations to
be cheating.
--

== Getting Help: Helping Each Other

[.slider]
* The course staff will be working as hard as you--and sometimes harder--but
there are many of you and few of us. Look to your left and your right: these
are your comrades.
* Good classes come through CSE 421/521 as a team.

== Collaboration

* Simple rule: talking about code is collaborating, talking in code (or
exchanging code) is cheating.
** Unless you are talking to your partner in which case anything goes.

== Cheaters

* I take cheating very seriously:
[.slider]
** Not because I am vindictive and mean...
** ... but because I believe in protecting and honoring those of you that
work hard and play by the rules.

[.meme-bottom]
No matter how long it takes

== Cheaters

* We will use an online service to detect and investigating code similarity.
[.slider]
** It is very fast, so we can it on every submission.
** It is very accurate.
** We will compare your assignment against everything we can think of: this
years', last years', anything you can find online, assignments submitted at
Harvard, etc.
** I have a _huge_ repository of old assignments now. If you can find it, I've
already got it.
