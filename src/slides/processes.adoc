== $ cat announce.txt

[.slider]
* Thanks for taking the preterm!
* If you are enrolled in the class you should be receiving course emails. If
you would like to sign up for the email list, here is the link:
[.spelling_exception]#https://www.ops-class.org/mailman/listinfo/ub#
* We are still working on the website
* Recitations will start next week.
* The add/drop deadline is *Monday February 1st.*
** You still have time this weekend to examine the assignments and
decide if this course is right for you right now.

[.nooutline]
== Office Hours Protocol

[.slider]
* *Location* -- we'll start in the third floor area outside the official TA
office and see how we go.
* Please be respectful of the TAs and ninjas:
[.slider]
** Bother them relentlessly _during_ office hours...
** and leave them alone _outside of_ office hours.

[.nooutline]
== Cold Calling

[.slider]
* I will cold call students during class, possibly using a tool integrate with
the slides.
* Cold calling is *not* designed to make anyone uncomfortable! Feel free to
pass or say "I don't know."

== Operating System Abstractions

.Abstractions _simplify application design_ by:
[.slider]
* *hiding undesirable properties*,
* *adding new capabilities*, and
* *organizing information*.

[.slide]
--
Abstractions provide an [.slide]*interface* to application programmers that
separates [.slide]*policy* -- what the interface commits to accomplishing--from
[.slide]*mechanism* -- how the interface is implemented.
--

== Example Abstraction: File

.What *undesirable properties* do files hide?
[.slider]
* Disks are slow!
* Chunks of storage are actually distributed all over the disk.
* Disk storage may fail!

.What *new capabilities* do files add?
[.slider]
* Growth and shrinking.
* Organization into directories.

.What *information* do files help organize?
[.slider]
* Ownership and permissions.
* Access time, modification time, type, etc.

== Preview of Coming Abstractions

[.slider]
* *Threads* abstract the CPU.
* *Address spaces* abstract memory.
* *Files* abstract the disk.
* We will return to these abstractions. We are starting with an
organizing principle.

== The Process

[.slider]
.*Processes are the most fundamental operating system abstraction.*
* Processes organize information about other abstractions and represent
a single thing that the computer is "doing."
* You know processes as [.spelling_exception]#app(lication)s#.

== Organizing Information

Unlike threads, address spaces and files, processes are *not tied to a
hardware component*. Instead, they contain other abstractions.

[.small.slider]
.Processes contain:
* one or more *threads*,
* an *address space*, and
* zero or more open *file handles* representing *files*.

== Process as Protection Boundary

The operating system is responsible for isolating processes from each
other.

[.slider]
* What you do in your own process is your own business *but it shouldn't
be able to crash the machine or effect other processes*â€”or at least
processes started by other users.
* Thus: safe intra-process communication is *your* problem; safe
inter-process communication is an *operating system* problem.

== Intra-Process Communication: Easy

image::figures/intraprocess.svg[width="100%"]

[.small.slider]
* Communication between multiple threads in a process is usually
accomplished using *shared memory*.
* Threads within a process also share open file handles and both static
and dynamically-allocated global variables.
* Thread stacks and thus thread local variables are typically private.

== [.small]#Intra-Process Communication: Easy... Maybe#

image::figures/intraprocess.svg[width="100%"]

[.slider]
* *Sharing data requires synchronization mechanisms to ensure
consistency.*
* We will return to this later.

== [.small]#Inter-Process Communication: Harder#

image::figures/interprocess.svg[width="100%"]

[.small.slider]
* A variety of mechanism exist to enable inter-process communication
(IPC), including shared files or sockets, exit codes, signals, pipes and
shared memory.
* All require coordination between the communicating processes.
* Most have semantics limiting the degree to which processes can
interfere with each other.
** A process can't just send a SIGKILL to any other process running on
the machine!

== $ wait # IPC: return codes

image::figures/returncode.svg[width="80%", role="expand"]

[.smaller.slider]
* Simplest and most-limited form of IPC.
* Allows processes to return a single int to the process that created
them.
* 0 typically indicates success; non-0, failure.
* Analogous to older computers that would transform a set of punch cards
into a "result."
* `bash` exposes return codes as `$?`:

== [.spelling_exception]#$ p | pes # IPC: pipes#

image::figures/pipes.svg[width="100%"]

[.slider]
* Pipes create a producer-consumer buffer between two processes.
* Allows the output from one process to be used as the input to another.
* The operating system manages a queue for each pipe to accommodate
different input and output rates.
* Facilitates the canonical chaining together of small UNIX utilities to
do more sophisticated processing.

Systems programming:
[.meme-bottom]
A series of pipes!

== [.spelling_exception]#$ kill -9 ubshuttle # IPC: signals#

image:figures/signals.svg[width="100%"]

[.small.slider]
* Signals are a limited form of asynchronous communication between
processes.
* Processes can register a *signal handler* to run when a signal is
received.
* Users can send signals to processes owned by them; the super-user can
send a signal to any process.
* Processes can ignore most signals.
** `SIGKILL` is a notable exception; used for non-graceful termination.
** `SIGTERM` is used for graceful shutdown and sent by Control-C.

== We Will Return to IPC

[.slider]
* *return codes* -- we will discuss again when we learn about `wait()` and
`_exit()`.
** You will implement return codes for ASST2.
* *pipes* -- we will discuss again when we learn about `fork()`.
* *signals* -- are difficult to use and implement and not something we will
return to.
* *shared memory* -- we will discuss again when we learn about address
spaces and virtual memory.

== Processes v. Threads

[.small.slider]
* Potential confusing due to overlapping terminology--we can describe
both a *process* and a *thread* as running.
* Terminology can be helpful for remembering the distinction:
** A computing *process* requires multiple resources: the CPU, memory,
files, etc.
** A *thread* of execution abstracts CPU state.
* Processes _contain_ threads; threads _belong_ to a process.
** Only one exception: the kernel may have threads of execution not
associated with any user process
** (Except the kernel process, which is a process, remember?)
* A process is considered to be running when one or more of its threads
are running.
* Different operating systems use different terminology, but share
common ideas.

== Process Example: Firefox

[.small]
--
[.slider]
.*Firefox has multiple threads. What are they doing?*
* Waiting for and processing interface events: mouse clicks, keyboard
input, etc.
* Redrawing the screen as necessary in response to user input, web page
loading, etc.
* Loading web pages--usually multiple parts _in parallel_ to speed
things up.

[.slider]
.*Firefox is using memory. For what?*
* Firefox.exe: the executable code of Firefox itself.
* Shared libraries for web page parsing, security, etc.
* Stacks storing local variables for running threads.
* A heap storing dynamically-allocated memory.

[.slider]
.*Firefox has files open. Why?*
* Configuration files.
* Fonts.

== Process Example: bash

[.slider]
* Let's do this for real using standard Linux system utilities.

== Finding bash

image::figures/finding-bash.svg[width="100%"]

[.slider]
* `ps aux` gives me all process, then `grep` for the one I'm after.
* ...or, do it all in one shot using `pgrep`.
* ...or, if I know it's running in my current session a bare `ps` will do.

== bash

image::figures/process-bash-3.svg[width="100%"]

== [.spelling_exception]#$ ps -Lf # thread information#

image::figures/threads-bash.svg[width="100%"]

[.small.slider]
.What are:
* `UID`: user the process is running as.
* `PID`: process ID.
* `PPID`: parent process ID.
* `PRI`: scheduling priority.
* `SZ`: size of the core image of the process (kB).
* `WCHAN`: if the process is not running, description of what it is
waiting on.
* `RSS`: total amount of resident memory is use by the process (kB).
* `TIME`: measure of the amount of time that the process has spent
running.

== [.spelling_exception]#$ ps -Lf # thread information#

image::figures/threads-bash.svg[width="100%"]

[.slider]
* If `bash` had multiple threads running this view would show them, so
`bash` does not have multiple threads.

== bash

image::figures/process-bash-2.svg[width="100%"]

== $ ps # process information

[.slider]
* I wish we could see a process with multiple threads...

== [.spelling_exception]#$ ps -Lf # thread information#

image::figures/ps-threads.svg[width="90%", role="expand"]

[.nooutline]
== Next Time

[.slider]
.The process lifecycle:
* *birth* (`fork()`),
* *change* (`exec()`),
* *death* (`exit()`), and
* *seance* (`wait()`).
* Seance?
